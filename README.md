# Neighborhood Map Project
A single page application featuring a map of a neighborhood with famous Restaurants.


## APIs
Google Maps API is used here to show the map and generate the markers etc.
Foursquare API is used to pull more information on my favorite locations and provide a more complete listing when you click on the marker and the infoWindow shows up.

## Installation
